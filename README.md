# Background
This repo contains links to University of Michigan EECS 498.008/598.008 Deep Learning for 
Computer Vision course assignments completed by Elliot.

UMich EECS 498.008/598.008 builds upon the Stanford University CS231n Deep Learning for Computer Vision course,
with additional topics on emerging Computer Vision research developments. 

From the UMich course description:  
"This course is a deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. 
During this course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a 
detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. We will cover learning algorithms, 
neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning networks for visual recognition tasks."
